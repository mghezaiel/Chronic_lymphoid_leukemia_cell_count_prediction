This tool was developed for the analysis of a Raman spectroscopy dataset obtained from patients with a Chronic lymphoid leukemia prognostic.
The tool allows to process and filter signal from lymphoid cells Raman spectra resulting in different by patient cell counts. 
It then performs a fisher exact test to check if the ratio of B/T-NK cells are consistent with the prognostic.

- docker run -p 8501:8501 cll_predictor
 
The app will start and be accessible through the web browser at: 
- localhost:8501


## Informations 
The app is built using the streamlit library and deployed using Docker. 
All requirements are handled by the dockerfile. 
Information on how to use the app is available via the app itself (How it works)
